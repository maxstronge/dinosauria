# Project Description
Create an interactive phylogenetic tree explorer for the clade Dinosauria, including all subclades down to the species level so users can see how their favorite dinosaurs are related to one another. Should also be able to filter and search different clades/parts of the family tree and sort them (for example, if I wanted to sort all the members of Megalosauroidea by size, or all members of Thyreophora chronologically, or find all the sauropods found in Alberta canada, etc). The tree should be interactive and allow users to click on different clades to see more information about them, including images, descriptions, and links to more information.

Status:
- Custom DB populated with dinosaur information (sourced from https://paleobiodb.org/#/ and the Wolfram Alpha knowledge base)
- Interactive force-based phylogeny graph

To-do:
- Individual species information pages
- Sorting/Filtering
- Toggle hierarchy view (no physics)
